Hi! My name is Yang Chen (Chinese:杨晨). I'm a third year undergraduate student at [Tsinghua University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsinghua_University). I'm interested in anything related to [$$p$$-adic geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03708). Currently, I'm trying to understand [topological cyclic homology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01799) and [prismatic cohomology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08229). You may find some related notes from my [blog](/blog).
